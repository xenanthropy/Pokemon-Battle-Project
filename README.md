# Pokemon-Battle-Project
Pokemon Battle program originally written in Python for my final project for Stanford's "Code in Place" online course

Over time I thought i'd challenge myself by re-working the program into a new language whenever I learn one. So far, the list of languages it has been written in are as follows:

Python
Ruby

To run the program, clone the repository, then navigate into the language project of your choice and run the program (ie. 'python final_project.py' or 'ruby final_project.rb', etc.)

So far, only 6 pokemon are available for selection, more may be added in the future.
